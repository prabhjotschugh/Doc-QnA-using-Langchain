The Indian  economy  has witnessed profound positive \\ntransformation in the last ten years. The people of India are \\nlooking ahead to the future with hope and optimism.  \\n2. With the blessings of the people, when our Government \\nunder the visionary and dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime \\nMinister Shri Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, the country \\nwas facing enormous challenges. With ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka \\nVikas’  as its ‘mantra’ , the Government overcame those \\nchallenges in right earnest. Structural reforms were undertaken. \\nPro-people programmes were formulated and implemented \\npromptly. Conditions were cr eated for more opportunities for \\nemployment and entrepreneurship. The economy got a new \\nvigour. The fruits of development started reaching the people at \\nscale. The country got a new sense of purpose and hope. \\nNaturally, the people blessed the Government wi th a bigger \\nmandate.  2 \\n 3. In the second term, our Government under the leadership \\nof Hon’ble Prime Minister doubled down on its responsibilities to \\nbuild a prosperous country with comprehensive development of \\nall people and all regions. Our Government strengthened its \\n‘mantra’  to ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwas’. Our \\ndevelopment philosophy covered all elements of inclusivity, \\nnamely,  \\n\\uf0b7 social inclusivity through coverage of all strata of the \\nsociety, and  \\n\\uf0b7 geographical  inclusivity through development of all \\nregions of the country.   \\n4. With the ‘whole of nation’ approach of ‘Sabka Prayas’, t he \\ncountry overcame the challenge of a once -in-a-century \\npandemic, took long strides towards ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, \\ncommitted to ‘Panch  Pran’ , and laid solid foundations for the  \\n‘Amrit Kaal’. As a result, our young country has high aspiration s, \\npride in its present, and hope and confidence for a bright future. \\nWe expect that our Government , based on  its stupendous work , \\nwill be blessed ag ain by the people with a resounding mandate.  \\nInclusive Development and Growth  \\n5. Our humane and inclusive approach to development is a \\nmarked and deliberate departure from the earlier approach of \\n‘provisioning up -to-village level’. Development programmes , in \\nthe last ten years, have targeted each and every household and \\nindividual, through ‘housing for all’, ‘har ghar jal’ , electricity for 3 \\n all, cooking gas for all, bank accounts and financial services for \\nall, in record time.  \\n6. The worries about food have been eliminated through free \\nration for 80 crore people. Minimum support prices for the \\nproduce of ‘Annadata’    are periodically increased appropriately. \\nThese and the provision of basic necessities have enhanced real \\nincome in the rural areas. Their econo mic needs could be \\naddressed, thus spurring growth and generating jobs.   \\nSocial Justice   \\n7. Our Government  is working with an approach to \\ndevelopment that is  all-round, all -pervasive and all -inclusive \\n(सर्वांगीण , सर्वस्पर्शी  और सर्वसमवर्ेर्शी ). It covers all castes and \\npeople at all levels. We are working to make India a ‘Viksit \\nBharat’ by 2047. For achieving that goal, we need to improve \\npeople’s capability and empower them.  \\n8. Previously, social justice was mostly a political slogan. For \\nour Gov ernment, social justice is an effective and necessary \\ngovernance model. The saturation approach of covering all \\neligible people is the true and comprehensive achievement of \\nsocial justice. This is secularism in action, reduces corruption, \\nand prevents nepo tism (भवई-भतीजवर्वद ). There is transparency \\nand assurance that benefits are delivered to all eligible people.  \\nThe resources are distributed fairly . All, regardless of their social \\nstanding, get access to opportunities. We are addressing \\nsystemic inequaliti es that had plagued our society. We focus on 4 \\n outcomes and not on outlays so that the socio -economic \\ntransformation is achieved.   \\n9. As our Prime Minister firmly believes , we need to focus on \\nfour major castes. They are, ‘Garib’ (Poor) , ‘Mahilayen’ \\n(Women),  ‘Yuva’  (Youth) and   ‘Annadata’ (Farmer). Their needs, \\ntheir aspirations, and their welfare are our highest priority. The \\ncountry progresses, when they progress. All four require and \\nreceive government support in their quest to better their lives. \\nTheir empo werment and well -being will drive the country \\nforward.  \\nGarib Kalyan, Desh ka Kalyan  \\n10. We believe in empowering the poor. The earlier approach \\nof tackling poverty through entitlements had resulted in very \\nmodest outcomes. When the poor become empowered partners \\nin the development process, government’s power to assist them \\nalso increases mani fold. With the pursuit of ‘Sabka ka Saath’  in \\nthese 10 years , the Government has assisted 25 crore people to \\nget freedom from multi -dimensional poverty. Our Government’s \\nefforts are now getting synergized with energy and passion of \\nsuch empowered people. T his is truly elevating them from \\npoverty.   \\n11. ‘Direct Benefit Transfer’ of ` 34 lakh crore from the \\nGovernment using PM -Jan Dhan accounts has led to savings of  \\n` 2.7 lakh crore  for the Government . This has been realized 5 \\n through avoidance of leakages prevale nt earlier. The savings \\nhave helped in providing more funds for ‘Garib Kalyan’.  \\n12. PM-SVANidhi has provide d credit assistance to 78 lakh \\nstreet vendors.  From that total, 2.3 lakh have received credit for \\nthe third time.  \\n13. PM-JANMAN Yojana reaches out to the particularly \\nvulnerable tribal groups, who have remained outside  the realm \\nof development so far. PM -Vishwakarma Yojana provides end -to-\\nend support to artisans and craftspeople engaged in 18 trades. \\nThe schemes for empowerment of Divyangs and Transgender \\nperson s reflect firm resolve of our  Government to leave no one \\nbehind.  \\nWelfare of Annadata  \\n14. Farmers are our ‘Annadata’ . Every year, under PM -KISAN \\nSAMMAN Yojana, direct financial assistance is provided to  \\n11.8 crore farmers, including marginal and small farmers.  Crop \\ninsurance is given to  4 crore farmers under PM Fasal Bima \\nYojana. These, besides several other programmes, are assisting \\n‘Annadata’  in producing food for the country and the world.  \\n15. Electroni c National Agriculture Market has integrated  \\n1361 mandis, and is providing services to 1.8 crore farmers with \\ntrading volume of ` 3 lakh crore.  \\n16. The sector is poised for inclusive, balanced, higher growth \\nand productivity. These are facilitated from farme r-centric \\npolicies, income support, coverage of risks through price and 6 \\n insurance support, promotion of technologies and innovations \\nthrough start -ups.  \\nEmpowering  Amrit Peed hi, the Yuva  \\n17. Our prosperity depends on adequately equipping and \\nempowering the youth. The National Education Policy 2020 is \\nushering in transformational reforms. PM ScHools for Rising India \\n(PM SHRI) are delivering quality teaching, and nurturing holistic \\nand well -roun ded individuals.  \\n18. The Skill India Mission has trained 1.4 crore youth, \\nupskilled and reskilled 54 lakh youth, and established 3000 new \\nITIs. A large number of new institutions of higher learning, \\nnamely 7 IITs, 16 IIITs, 7 IIMs, 15 AIIMS and 390 universiti es have \\nbeen set up.   \\n19. PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans \\naggregating to ` 22.5 lakh crore for entrepreneurial aspirations \\nof our youth. Besides that, Fund of Funds, Start Up India, and \\nStart Up Credit Guarantee schemes are assisting our youth. They \\nare also becoming ‘rozgardata’.  \\n20. The country is proud of our youth scaling new heights in \\nsports. The highest ever medal tally in Asian Games and Asian \\nPara Games in 2023 reflects a high confidence level. Chess \\nprodigy and our Number -One ranked player  Praggnanandhaa put \\nup a stiff fight against the reigning World Champion Magnus \\nCarlsson in 2023. Today, India has over 80 chess grandmasters \\ncompared to little over 20 in 2010.  7 \\n Momentum for Nari Shakti  \\n21. The empowerment of women through entrepreneurship, \\nease of living, and dignity for them has gained momentum in \\nthese ten years.  \\n22. Thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans have been given to \\nwomen entrepreneurs. Female enrolment in higher education \\nhas gone up by twenty -eight per cent in ten years. In STEM \\ncourses, gir ls and women constitute forty -three per cent of \\nenrolment - one of the highest in the world. All these measures \\nare getting reflected in the increasing participation of women in \\nworkforce . \\n23. Making ‘Triple Talaq’ illegal, reservation of one -third seats \\nfor w omen in the Lok Sabha and State legislative assemblies, and \\ngiving over seventy per cent houses under PM Awas Yojana in \\nrural areas to women as sole or joint owners have enhanced \\ntheir dignity.  \\nExemplary  Track Record of Governance, Development and \\nPerformance (GDP)  \\n24. Besides delivering on high growth in terms of Gross \\nDomestic Product, the Government is equally focused on a more \\ncomprehensive ‘GDP’ , i.e ., ’Governance, Development and \\nPerformance’ .   \\n25. Our G overnment has provided transparent, accountable, \\npeople -centric and prompt trust -based administration with 8 \\n ‘citizen -first’ and ‘minimum government, maximum governance’ \\napproach.  \\n26. The impact of all -round development is discernible in all \\nsectors. There is mac ro-economic stability, including in the \\nexternal sector. Investments are robust. The economy is doing \\nwell.  \\n27. People are living better and earning better, with even \\ngreater aspirations for the future. Average real income of the \\npeople has increased by fifty  per cent. Inflation is moderate. \\nPeople are getting empowered, equipped and enabled to pursue \\ntheir aspirations. There is effective and timely delivery of \\nprogrammes and of large projects.  \\nEconomic Management  \\n28. The multipronged economic management over the  past \\nten years has complemented people -centric inclusive \\ndevelopment. Following are some of the major elements.   \\n(1) All forms of infrastructure , physical, digital or social, \\nare being built in record time.   \\n(2) All parts of the country are becoming active \\nparticipants in economic  growth.  \\n(3) Digital Public Infrastructure, a new ‘factor of \\nproduction ’ in the 21st century, is instrumental in \\nformalization of the economy.      9 \\n (4) Goods and Services Tax has enabled ‘One Nation, \\nOne Market, One Tax’ . Tax reforms have led to \\ndeepening  and widening of tax base.  \\n(5) Strengthening of the financial sector has helped in \\nmaking savings, credit and investments more \\nefficient.   \\n(6) GIFT IFSC and the unified regulatory authority, IFSCA \\nare creating a robust gateway for global capital and \\nfinancial services for the economy.  \\n(7) Proactive inflation management has helped keep  \\ninflation within  the policy band.   \\nGlobal Context  \\n29. Geopolitically , global affairs are becoming more complex \\nand challenging with wars and conflicts. Globalization is being \\nredefined with reshoring and friend -shoring, disruption and \\nfragmentation of supply chains, and competition for critical \\nminerals and technologies. A  new world order is emerging after \\nthe Covid pandemic.  \\n30. India assumed G20  Presidency during very difficult times \\nfor the world. The global economy was going through high \\ninflation, high interest rates, low growth, very high public debt, \\nlow trade growth, and climate challenges. The pandemic had led \\nto a crisis of food, fertiliz er, fuel and finances for the world, while \\nIndia successfully  navigated its way. The country showed the way 10 \\n forward and built consensus on solutions for those global \\nproblems.  \\n31. The recently announced India -Middle East -Europe \\nEconomic Corridor is a strategi c and economic game changer for \\nIndia and others. In the words of Hon’ble Prime Minister, the \\ncorridor “will become the basis of world trade for hundreds of \\nyears to come, and history will remember that this corridor was \\ninitiated on Indian soil” .   \\nVision  for ‘Viksit Bharat’  \\n32. Our vision for ‘Viksit Bharat’ is that of “Prosperous Bharat \\nin harmony with nature, with modern infrastructure, and \\nproviding opportunities for all citizens and all regions to reach \\ntheir potential”.  \\n33. With confidence arising from stron g and exemplary track -\\nrecord of performance and progress earning ‘Sabka Vishwas’ , the \\nnext five years will be years of unprecedented development, and \\ngolden moments to realize the dream of developed India  @ \\n2047. The trinity of demography, democracy and di versity \\nbacked by ‘Sabka Prayas’ has the potential to fulfill aspirations of \\nevery Indian.  \\n34. As Hon’ble Prime Minister in his Independence Day \\naddress to the nation mentioned, “There is no dearth of \\nopportunities; as many opportunities as we want. The count ry is \\ncapable of creating more opportunities. Sky's the limit” . \\n 11 \\n Strategy for ‘Amrit Kaal’  \\n35. Our Government will adopt  economic policies that foster \\nand sustain growth, facilitate inclusive and sustainable \\ndevelopment, improve productivity, create opportunities for all, \\nhelp them enhance their capabilities, and contribute to \\ngeneration of resources to power investments an d fulfil \\naspirations.   \\n36. Guided by the principle ‘Reform , Perform, and Transform’, \\nthe Government will take up next generation reforms, and build \\nconsensus with the states and stakeholders for effective \\nimplementation.   \\n37. It is an important policy priority for our Government to \\nensure timely and adequate finances, relevant technologies and \\nappropriate training for the Micro, Small and Medium \\nEnterprises (MSME) to grow and also compete globally. Orienting \\nthe regulatory envi ronment to facilitate their growth will be an \\nimportant element of this policy mix.  \\n38. Aligning with the ‘Panchamrit’  goals, our Government will \\nfacilitate sustaining high and more resource -efficient economic \\ngrowth. This will work towards energy  security in terms of \\navailability, accessibility and affordability.   \\n39. For me eting the investment needs our G overnment will \\nprepare the financial sector in terms of size, capacity, skills and \\nregulatory framework.  \\n 12 \\n Aspirational Districts Programme  \\n40. Our Government stands ready to assist the states in faster \\ndevelopment of aspirational districts  and blocks , including \\ngeneration of ample economic opportunities.  \\nDevelopment of the East   \\n41. Our G overnment will pay utmost attention to make the \\neastern region and its people  a powerful driver of India’s growth .  \\nPM Awas Yojana (Grameen)  \\n42. Despite the challenges due to COVID, implementation of \\nPM Awas Yojana (Grameen) continued  and we are close to \\nachieving the target of three  crore houses. Two  crore more \\nhouses wi ll be taken up in the next five years to meet the \\nrequirement arising from increase in the number of families.   \\nRooftop solarization and muft bijli  \\n43.   Through rooftop solarization, one crore households will \\nbe enabled to obtain up to 300 units free electri city every month. \\nThis scheme follows the resolve of Hon’ble Prime Minister on the \\nhistoric day of consecration of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.  \\nFollowing benefits are expected.  \\na. Savings up to fifteen to eighteen thousand rupees \\nannually for households from free solar electricity and \\nselling the surplus to the distribution companies;  \\nb. Charging of electric vehicles;  13 \\n c. Entrepreneurship opportunities for a large number of \\nvendors for supply and installation;  \\nd. Employment opportunities for the youth with technical \\nskills i n manufacturing, installation and maintenance;  \\nHousing for middle class  \\n44. Our Government will launch a scheme to help deserving \\nsections of the middle class “living in rented houses, or slums, or \\nchawls and unauthorized colonies” to buy or build their own \\nhouses.   \\nMedical Colleges  \\n45. Several youth are ambitious to get qualified as doctors. \\nThey aim to serve our people through improved healthcare \\nservices. Our Government plans to set up more medical colleges \\nby utilizing the existing hospital infrastructure under various \\ndepartments. A committee for this purpose will be set -up to \\nexamine the issues and make relevant recommendations .  \\nCervical Cancer Vaccination  \\n46. Our Government will encourage vaccination for girls in age \\ngroup of 9 to 14 years for prevention of cervical cancer.     \\nMaterna l and child health care  \\n47. Various schemes for maternal and child care will be \\nbrought under one comprehensive programme for synergy in \\nimplementation. Upgradation of anganwadi centres under \\n“Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0” will be expedited for 14 \\n improved nu trition delivery, early childhood care and \\ndevelopment.    \\n48. The newly designed U -WIN platform for managing \\nimmunization and intensified efforts of Mission Indradhanush \\nwill be rolled out expeditiously throughout the country.  \\nAyushman Bharat  \\n49. Healthcare cove r under Ayushman Bharat scheme will be \\nextended to all ASHA workers, Anganwadi Workers and Helpers.  \\nAgriculture and food processing  \\n50. The efforts for value addition in agricultural sector and \\nboosting farmers’ income will be stepped up. Pradhan Mantri \\nKisan  Sampada Yojana has benefitted 38 lakh farmers and \\ngenerated 10 lakh employment. Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of \\nMicro Food Processing Enterprises Yojana has assisted 2.4 lakh \\nSHGs and sixty thousand individuals with credit linkages. Other \\nschemes are comp lementing the efforts for reducing post -\\nharvest losses, and improving productivity and incomes.  \\n51. For ensuring faster growth of the sector, our Government \\nwill further promote p rivate and public investment in  \\npost -harvest activities including aggregation, modern storage, \\nefficient supply chains, primary and secondary processing and \\nmarketing and branding.  \\n \\n 15 \\n Nano DAP  \\n52. After the successful adoption of Nano Urea, application of \\nNano DAP on various crops will be expanded in all agro -climatic \\nzones.   \\nAtmanirbhar  Oil Seeds Abhiyan  \\n53. Building on the initiative announced in 2022, a strategy \\nwill be formulated to achieve ‘atmanirbharta’  for oil seeds such \\nas mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower. This \\nwill cover research for high -yielding varieties, widesp read \\nadoption of modern farming techniques, market linkages, \\nprocurement, value addition, and crop insurance.      \\nDairy Development  \\n54. A comprehensive programme for  supporting dairy farmers \\nwill be formulated. Efforts are already on to control foot and \\nmouth  disease. India is the world’s largest milk producer but \\nwith low productivity of milch -animals. The programme will be \\nbuilt on the success of existing schemes such Rashtriya Gokul \\nMission, National Livestock Mission, and Infrastructure \\nDevelopment Funds f or dairy processing and animal husbandry.   \\nMatsya Sampada  \\n55. It was our Government which set up a separate \\nDepartment for Fisheries realizing the importance of assisting \\nfishermen. This has resulted in doubling of both inland and \\naquaculture production. Seaf ood export since 2013 -14 has also 16 \\n doubled.  Implementation of Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada \\nYojana (PMMSY) will be stepped up to:  \\n(1) enhance aquaculture productivity from existing 3 to  \\n5 tons per hectare,  \\n(2) double exports to ` 1 lakh crore and  \\n(3) generate  55 lakh employment opportunities in near \\nfuture.  \\nFive integrated aquaparks will be setup.  \\nLakhpati Didi  \\n56. Eighty -three lakh SHGs  with nine crore women are \\ntransforming rural socio -economic landscape with \\nempowerment and self -reliance. Their success has as sisted \\nnearly one crore women to become Lakhpati Didi already. They \\nare an inspiration to others. Their achievements will be \\nrecognized through honouring them. Buoyed by the success, it \\nhas been decided to enhance the target for Lakhpati Didi from  \\n2 crore to 3 crore.  \\nTechnological Changes  \\n57. New age technologies  and data  are changing the lives of \\npeople and businesses. The y are also enabling new economic \\nopportunities and facilitating provision of high -quality services at \\naffordable prices for all, inc luding those at ‘bottom of the \\npyramid’. Opportunities for India at the global level are 17 \\n expanding. India is showing solutions through innovation and \\nentrepreneurship of its people.  \\nResearch and Innovation for catalyzing growth, employment \\nand development  \\n58. Prime Minister Shastri gave the slogan of “Jai Jawan Jai \\nKisan”. Prime Minister Vajpayee made that “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan \\nJai Vigyan”. Prime Minister Modi has furthered that to “Jai \\nJawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan and Jai Anusandhan” , as innovation is \\nthe founda tion of development.  \\n59. For our tech savvy youth, this will be a golden era.  \\nA corpus of rupees  one lakh crore will be established with  \\nfifty-year interest free loan . The corpus will provide long -term \\nfinancing or refinancing with long tenors and low or nil interest \\nrates. This will encourage the private sector  to scale up research \\nand innovation significantly in sunrise domains. We need to have \\nprogrammes that combin e the powers of our youth and \\ntechnology.  \\n60. A new scheme will be launched for strengthening  \\ndeep -tech technologies for defence purposes and expediting \\n‘atmanirbharta’ .    \\nInfrastructure Development  \\n61. Building on the massive tripling of the capital expenditure  \\noutlay in the past 4 years resulting in huge multiplier impact on \\neconomic growth and employment creation, the outlay for the \\nnext year is being increased by 11.1 per cent to eleven lakh, 18 \\n eleven thousand, one hundred and eleven crore rupees  \\n(` 11,11,111 crore). This would be 3.4 per cent of the GDP.  \\nRailways  \\n62. Three major economic railway corridor programmes will \\nbe implemented. These are : \\n(1) energy, mineral and cement corridors,  \\n(2) port connectivity corridors, and  \\n(3) high traffic density corridors.  \\nThe projects have been identified under the PM Gati Shakti for \\nenabling multi -modal connectivity. They will improve logistics \\nefficiency and reduce cost.  \\n63.   The resultant decongestion of the high -traffic corridors \\nwill also help in improving operations of passenger trains, \\nresulting in safety and higher travel speed for passengers. \\nTogether with dedicated freight corridors, these three economic \\ncorridor programmes will accelerate our GDP growth and reduce \\nlogistic costs.   \\n64. Forty thousand normal rail bogies will be converted to the \\nVande Bharat standards to enhance safety , convenience and \\ncomfort  of passengers.   \\nAviation Sector  \\n65. The aviation sector has been galvanized in the past  \\nten years. Number of airports have  doubled to 149. Roll out of \\nair connectivity to tier -two and tier -three cities under UDAN 19 \\n scheme has been widespread.  Five hundred and seventeen new \\nroutes are carrying 1.3 crore passengers. Indian carriers have  \\npro-actively plac ed orders for over 1000 n ew aircrafts. Expansion \\nof existing airports and development of new airports will \\ncontinue expeditiously.  \\nMetro and NaMo Bharat  \\n66. We have a fast -expanding middle class and rapid \\nurbanization is taking place.  Metro Rail and NaMo Bharat can be \\nthe catalyst f or the required urban transformation. Expansion of \\nthese systems will be supported in large cities focusing on \\ntransit -oriented development.  \\nGreen Energy  \\n67. Towards meeting our commitment for ‘net -zero’ by 2070, \\nthe following measures will be taken.  \\na. Viabilit y gap funding will be provided for harnessing \\noffshore wind energy potential for initial capacity of \\none giga -watt.  \\nb. Coal gasification and liquefaction capacity of 100 MT \\nwill be set up by 2030. This will also help in reducing \\nimports of natural gas, methanol, and ammonia.   \\nc. Phased mandatory blending of compressed biogas  \\n(CBG)  in compressed natural gas (CNG) for transport \\nand piped natural gas  (PNG)  for domestic purposes will \\nbe mandated.  20 \\n d. Financial  assistance will be provided for procurement \\nof biomass aggregation machinery to support \\ncollection . \\nElectric Vehicle Eco system  \\n68. Our Government will expand and strengthen the e -vehicle \\necosystem  by supporting manufacturing and charging \\ninfrastructure. Greater adoption of e -buses for public transport \\nnetworks will be encouraged through payment security \\nmechanism.  \\nBio-manufacturing and Bio -foundry  \\n69. For promotin g green growth, a new scheme of  \\nbio-manufacturing and bio -foundry will be launched. This will \\nprovide environment friendly alternatives such as biodegradable \\npolymers, bio -plastics, bio -pharmaceuticals and bio -agri-inputs.  \\nThis scheme will also help in transforming today’s consumptive \\nmanufacturing paradigm to the one based on regenerative \\nprinciples.  \\nBlue Economy 2.0  \\n70. For promoting climate resilient activities for blue economy \\n2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and \\ncoastal aquaculture and mariculture with integrated a nd  \\nmulti -sectoral approach will be launched.  \\n \\n 21 \\n Comprehensive development of tourist centres  \\n71. The success of organizing G20 meetings in sixty places \\npresented diversity of India to global audience. Our economic \\nstrength has made the country an attractive de stination for \\nbusiness and conference tourism. Our middle class also now \\naspires to travel and explore. Tourism, including spiritual \\ntourism, ha s tremendous opportunities for local \\nentrepreneurship . \\n72. States will be encouraged to take up comprehensive \\ndevelopment of iconic tourist centres, branding and marketing \\nthem at global scale. A framework for rating of the centres based \\non quality of facilities and services will be established. Long -term \\ninterest free loans will be provided to States for financin g such \\ndevelopment on matching basis.  \\n73. To address the emerging fervour for domestic tourism, \\nprojects for port connectivity, tourism infrastructure, and \\namenities will be taken up on our islands, including \\nLakshadweep. This will help in generating employmen t also.  \\nPromoting Investments  \\n74. The FDI inflow during 2014 -23 was USD 596 billion marking \\na golden era .  That is twice the inflow during 2005 -14.   \\nFor encouraging sustained foreign investment, we are \\nnegotiating bilateral investment treaties with our foreig n \\npartners, in the spirit of ‘first develop India’.  \\n 22 \\n Reforms in the States for ‘ Viksit Bharat’  \\n75. Many growth and development enabling reforms are \\nneeded in the states for realizing the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’.  \\nA provision of seventy -five thousand crore rupees as fifty-year \\ninterest free loan is proposed this year to support those \\nmilestone -linked reforms by the State Governments.    \\nSocietal Changes  \\n76. The Government will form a high -powered committee for \\nan extensive consideration of the challenges arising from fast \\npopulation growth and demographic changes.  The committee \\nwill be mandated to make recommendations for addressing \\nthese challenges comprehensively in relation to the goal of \\n‘Viksit Bharat’.  \\nAmrit Kaal as Kartavya Kaal  \\n77. Our G overnment stands committed to strengthening and \\nexpanding the economy with high growth and to create \\nconditions for people to realize their aspirations.  Hon’ble Prime \\nMinister in his Independence Day address to the nation, in the \\n75th year of our Republic  said; we “commit ourselves to national \\ndevelopment, with new inspirations, new consciousness, new \\nresolutions, as the country opens up immense possibilities and \\nopportunities” . It is our ‘Kartavya Kaal’.  \\n78. Every challenge of the pre-2014  era was overcome \\nthrough our economic management and our governance. These \\nhave placed the country on a resolute path of sustained high 23 \\n growth.  This has been possible through our right policies, true \\nintentions, and appropriate decisions. In the full budget in July, \\nour Government will present a detailed roadmap for our pursuit \\nof ‘Viksit Bharat’ .  \\nRevised Estimates 2023 -24 \\n79. The Revised Estimate of the total receipts other than \\nborrowings is ` 27.56  lakh crore, of which the tax receipts are  \\n` 23.24  lakh crore. The Revised Estimate of the total expenditure \\nis ` 44.90  lakh crore.      \\n80. The revenue receipts at ` 30.03  lakh crore are expected to \\nbe higher than the Budget Estimate, reflecting strong growth \\nmomentum and formalization in the economy.  \\n81. The R evised Estimate of the fiscal deficit is 5.8 per cent of \\nGDP, improving on the Budget Estimate, notwithstanding \\nmoderation in the nominal growth estimates.        \\nBudget Estimates 2024 -25 \\n82. Coming to 2024 -25, the total receipts other than \\nborrowings and the total expenditure are estimated at ` 30.80  \\nand 47.66  lakh crore respectively. The tax receipts are estimated \\nat ` 26.02  lakh crore.     \\n83. The scheme of fifty-year interest free loan for capital \\nexpenditure to states will be continued this year with total out lay \\nof  ` 1.3 lakh crore.   24 \\n 84. We continue on the path of fiscal consolidation, as \\nannounced in my Budget Speech for 2021 -22, to reduce fiscal \\ndeficit below 4.5 per cent by 2025 -26. The fiscal deficit in  \\n2024 -25 is estimated to be 5.1 per cent of GDP, adhering to that \\npath.  \\n85.  The gross and net market borrowings through  dated \\nsecurities during 2024 -25 are estimated at ` 14.13  and  \\n11.75  lakh crore respectively. Both will be less than that in  \\n2023 -24. Now that the private investments ar e happening at \\nscale, the lower borrowings by the Central Government will \\nfacilitate larger availability of credit for the private sector.   \\nVote on Account  \\n86. I will be seeking ‘vote on account’ approval of the \\nParliament through the Appropriation Bill for a part of the \\nfinancial year  2024 -25.    \\nI will, now, move to Part B.  \\n  25 \\n Part B  \\nHon’ble Speaker Sir,  \\nDirect taxes  \\n87. Over the last ten years, the direct tax collections have \\nmore than trebled and the return filers swelled to 2.4 times.  \\nI would like to assure the taxpayers that their contributions have \\nbeen used wisely for the development of the country and \\nwelfare of its people. I appreciate the tax payers for their \\nsupport.  \\n88. The Government has reduced and rationalized tax rates. \\nUnder the new tax scheme, there  is now no tax liability for tax \\npayers with income up to ₹ 7 lakh, up from ₹ 2.2 lakh in the \\nfinancial year 2013 -14. The threshold for presumptive taxation \\nfor retail businesses was increased from ₹ 2 crore to ₹ 3 crore. \\nSimilarly, the threshold for professionals eligible for presumptive \\ntaxation was increased from ₹ 50 lakh to  ₹ 75 Lakh.  Also, \\ncorporate tax rate was decreased from 30 per cent to 22 per cent \\nfor existing domestic companies and to 15 per cent for certain \\nnew manufacturing companies.  \\n89. In the last five years, our focus has been to improve  \\ntax-payer services. The age -old jurisdiction -based assessment \\nsystem was transformed with the introduction of Faceless \\nAssessment and Appeal, thereby imparting greater efficiency, \\ntransparency and accoun tability. Introduction of updated income \\ntax returns, a new Form 26AS and prefilling of tax returns have 26 \\n made filing of tax returns simpler and easier. Average processing \\ntime of returns has been reduced from 93 days in the year  \\n2013 -14 to a mere ten days  this year, thereby making refunds \\nfaster.  \\nIndirect Taxes   \\n90. By unifying the highly fragmented indirect tax regime in \\nIndia, GST has reduced the compliance burden on trade and \\nindustry. The industry has acknowledged the benefits of GST. \\nAccording to a recen t survey conducted by a leading consulting \\nfirm, 94  per cent  of industry leaders view the transition to GST as \\nlargely positive. According to 80  per cent  of the respondents, it \\nhas led to supply chain optimisation, as elimination of tax \\narbitrage and octro i has resulted in disbanding of check posts at \\nstate and city boundaries. At the same time, tax base of GST \\nmore than doubled and the average monthly gross GST \\ncollection has almost doubled to ₹ 1.66 lakh crore, this year.  \\nStates too have benefited. States ’ SGST revenue, including \\ncompensation released to states, in the post -GST period of  \\n2017 -18 to 2022 -23, has achieved a buoyancy of 1.22. In \\ncontrast, the tax buoyancy of State revenues from subsumed \\ntaxes in the pre -GST four -year period of 2012 -13 to 201 5-16 was \\na mere 0.72. The biggest beneficiaries are the consumers, as \\nreduction in logistics costs and taxes have brought down prices \\nof most goods and services.  27 \\n 91. We have taken a number of steps in Customs to facilitate \\ninternational trade. As a result, the  import release time declined \\nby 47  per cent to 71 hours at Inland Container Depots, by 28  per \\ncent  to 44 hours at air cargo complexes and by 27  per cent  to  \\n85 hours at sea ports, over the last four years since 2019, when \\nthe National Time Release Studies  were first started.  \\nTax proposals  \\n92. As for tax proposals, in keeping with the convention, I do \\nnot propose to make any changes relating to taxation and \\npropose to retain the same tax rates for direct taxes and indirect \\ntaxes including import duties. However , certain tax benefits to \\nstart -ups and investments made by sovereign wealth or pension \\nfunds as also tax exemption on certain income of some IFSC units \\nare expiring on 31.03.2024. To provide continuity in taxation,  \\nI propose to extend the date to 31.03.2 025.  \\n93. Moreover, in line with  our Government’s vision to improve \\nease of living and ease of doing business, I wish to make an \\nannouncement to improve tax payer services. There are a large \\nnumber of petty, non -verified, non -reconciled or disputed direct \\ntax d emands, many of them dating as far back as the year 1962, \\nwhich continue to remain on the books, causing anxiety to \\nhonest tax payers and hindering refunds of subsequent years.  \\nI propose to withdraw such outstanding direct tax demands up \\nto twenty -five th ousand rupees ( ₹ 25,000 ) pertaining to the \\nperiod up to financial year 2009 -10 and up to ten-thousand 28 \\n rupees ( ₹ 10,000 ) for financial years 2010 -11 to 2014 -15. This is \\nexpected to benefit about a crore tax-payers.  \\nEconomy – Then and Now  \\n94. In 2014 when our Government assumed the reins, the \\nresponsibility to mend the economy step by step and to put the \\ngovernance systems in order was enormous. The need of the \\nhour was to give hope to the people, to attract investments, and \\nto build support for the much -needed reforms. The Government \\ndid that successfully following our strong belief of ‘nation -first’.   \\n95. The crisis of those years has been overcome, and the \\neconomy has been put firmly on a high sustainable growth path \\nwith all -round development. It is now appropri ate to look at \\nwhere we were then till 2014 and where we are now, only for \\nthe purpose of drawing lessons from the mismanagement of \\nthose years. The Government will lay a White Paper on table of \\nthe House.  \\n96. The exemplary track record of governance, develop ment \\nand performance , effective delivery , and ‘Jan Kalyan ’ has given \\nthe Government trust, confidence and blessings of the people to \\nrealize, whatever it takes, the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’ with good \\nintentions, true dedication and hard work in the coming y ears \\nand decades .   \\n97. With this, I commend the interim budget to this august \\nHouse.  \\nJai Hind.  \""

Be sure to follow along, try the activities, and ask lots of questions!\\n\\nLicense\\n\\nThe prose, course text, slide layouts, class outlines, diagrams, HTML, CSS, and Markdown code in the set of educational materials located in this repository are licensed as CC BY 4.0. The Octocat, GitHub logo and other already-copyrighted and already-reserved trademarks and images are not covered by this license.\\n\\nFor more information, visit: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\\n\\nLicense | 1\\n\\nGetting Ready for Class\\n\\nWhile you are waiting for class to begin, please take a few minutes to set up your local work environment.\\n\\nStep 1: Set Up Your GitHub.com Account\\n\\nFor this class, we will use a public account on GitHub.com. We do this for a few reasons:\\n\\nWe don’t want you to \"practice\" in repositories that contain real code.\\n\\nWe are going to break some things so we can teach you how to fix\\n\\nthem. (therefore, refer to #1 above)\\n\\nIf you already have a github.com account you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can set up your free account by following these steps:\\n\\n1. Access GitHub.com and click Sign up.\\n\\n2. Choose the free account.\\n\\n3. You will receive a verification email at the address provided.\\n\\n4. Click the link to complete the verification process.\\n\\nStep 2: Install Git\\n\\nGit is an open source version control application. You will need Git installed for this class.\\n\\nYou may already have Git installed so let’s check! Open Terminal if you are on a Mac, or Powershell if you are on a Windows machine, and type:\\n\\n$ git --version\\n\\nYou should see something like this:\\n\\n$ git --version git version 2.6.3\\n\\nAnything over 1.9.5 will work for this class!\\n\\n2 | Getting Ready for Class\\n\\nDownloading and Installing Git\\n\\nIf you don’t already have Git installed, you have two options:\\n\\n1. Download and install Git at www.git-scm.com.\\n\\n2. Install it as part of the GitHub Desktop package found at\\n\\ndesktop.github.com.\\n\\nIf you need additional assistance installing Git, you can find more information in the ProGit chapter on installing Git: http://git- scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.\\n\\nWhere is Your Shell?\\n\\nNow is a good time to create a shortcut to the command line application you will want to use with Git:\\n\\nIf you are working on Windows, you can use PowerShell or Git\\n\\nShell which is installed with the Git package.\\n\\nIf you are working on a Mac or other Unix based system, you can use\\n\\nthe terminal application.\\n\\nGo ahead and open your command line application now!\\n\\nStep 3: Set Up Your Text Editor\\n\\nFor this class, we will use a basic text editor to interact with our code. Let’s make sure you have one installed and ready to work from the command line.\\n\\nPick Your Editor\\n\\nYou can use almost any text editor, but we have the best success with the following:\\n\\nGitPad\\n\\natom\\n\\nVi or Vim\\n\\nStep 3: Set Up Your Text Editor | 3\\n\\nSublime\\n\\nNotepad or Notepad++\\n\\nIf you do not already have a text editor installed, go ahead and download and install one of the above editors now!\\n\\nYour Editor on the Command Line\\n\\nAfter you have install an editor, confirm you can open it from the command line. If you are working on a Mac, you will need to Install Shell Commands from the Atom menu, this happens as part of the installation process for Windows.\\n\\nIf installed properly, the following command will open the atom text editor:\\n\\n$ atom .\\n\\nExploring\\n\\nCongratulations! You should now have a working version of Git and a text editor on your system. If you still have some time before class begins, here are some interesting resources you can check out:\\n\\ngithub.com/explore Explore is a showcase of interesting projects in the GitHub Universe. See something you want to re-visit? Star the repository to make it easier to find later.\\n\\ntraining.github.com/kit The Training Kit is GitHub’s open source\\n\\ntraining materials. The kit contains additional resources you may find helpful when reviewing what you have learned in class! You can even make contributions to the materials or open issues if you would like us to explain something in greater detail!\\n\\n4 | Getting Ready for Class\\n\\nGetting Started With Collaboration\\n\\nWe will start by introducing you to Git, GitHub, and the collaboration features we will use throughout the class. Even if you have used GitHub in the past, we hope this information will provide a baseline understanding of how to use it to build better software!\\n\\nWhat is GitHub?\\n\\nGitHub is a collaboration platform built on top of a distributed version control system called Git.\\n\\nFigure 1. GitHub’s beloved Octocat logo.\\n\\nIn addition to being a place to host and share your Git projects, GitHub provides a number of features to help you and your team collaborate more effectively. These features include:\\n\\nIssues\\n\\nPull Requests\\n\\nOrganizations and Teams\\n\\nWhat is GitHub? | 5\\n\\nFigure 2. Key GitHub Features.\\n\\nRather than force you into a \"one size fits all\" ecosystem, GitHub strives to be the place that brings all of your favorite tools together. You may even find some new, indispensable tools like continuous integration and continuous deployment to help you and your team build software better, together.\\n\\nFigure 3. The GitHub Ecosystem.\\n\\nWhat is Git?\\n\\nGit is:\\n\\na distributed version control system or DVCS.\\n\\nfree and open source.\\n\\ndesigned to handle everything from small to very large projects with\\n\\nspeed and efficiency.\\n\\neasy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.\\n\\nGit outclasses many other SCM tools with features like cheap local\\n\\n6 | Getting Started With Collaboration\\n\\nbranching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.\\n\\nAs we begin to discuss Git (and what makes it special) it would be helpful if you could forget everything you know about other version control systems (VCSs) for just a moment. Git stores and thinks about information very differently than other VCSs.\\n\\nWe will learn more about how Git stores your code as we go through this class, but the first thing you will need to understand is how Git works with your content.\\n\\nSnapshots, not Deltas\\n\\nOne of the first ideas you will need understand is that Git does not store your information as series of changes. Instead Git takes a snapshot of your repository at a given point in time. This snapshot is called a commit.\\n\\nOptimized for Local Operations\\n\\nGit is optimized for local operation. When you clone a copy of a repository to your local machine, you receive a copy of the entire repository and its history. This means you can work on the plane, on the train, or anywhere else your adventures find you!\\n\\nBranches are Lightweight and Cheap\\n\\nBranches are an essential concept in Git.\\n\\nWhen you create a new branch in Git, you are actually just creating a pointer that corresponds to the most recent snapshot in a line of work. Git keeps the snapshots for each branch separate until you explicitly tell it to merge those snapshots into the main line of work.\\n\\nGit is Explicit\\n\\nWhich brings us to our final point for now; Git is very explicit. It does not do anything until you tell it to. No auto-saves or auto-syncing with the remote, Git waits for you to tell it when to take a snapshot and when to send that snapshot to the remote.\\n\\nWhat is Git? | 7\\n\\nExploring a GitHub Repository\\n\\nA repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It is easiest to imagine as a project’s folder. However, unlike an ordinary folder on your laptop, a GitHub repository offers simple yet powerful tools for collaborating with others. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file’s revision history. Whether you are just curious or you are a major contributor, knowing your way around a repository is essential!\\n\\nFigure 4. GitHub Repositories.\\n\\nRepository Navigation\\n\\nCode\\n\\nThe code view is where you will find the files included in the repository. These files may contain the project code, documentation, and other important files. We also call this view the root of the project. Any changes to these files will be tracked via Git version control.\\n\\nIssues\\n\\nIssues are used to track bugs and feature requests. Issues can be assigned to specific team members and are designed to encourage\\n\\n8 | Getting Started With Collaboration\\n\\ndiscussion and collaboration.\\n\\nPull Requests\\n\\nA Pull Request represents a change, such as adding, modifying, or deleting files, which the author would like to make to the repository. Pull Requests are used to resolve Issues.\\n\\nWiki\\n\\nWikis in GitHub can be used to communicate project details, display user documentation, or almost anything your heart desires. And of course, GitHub helps you keep track of the edits to your Wiki!\\n\\nPulse\\n\\nPulse is your project’s dash board. It contains information on the work that has been completed and the work in progress.\\n\\nGraphs\\n\\nGraphs provide a more granular view into the repository activity, including who has contributed, when the work is being done, and who has forked the repository.\\n\\nREADME.md\\n\\nThe README.md is a special file that we recommend all repositories contain. GitHub looks for this file and helpfully displays it below the repository. The README should explain the project and point readers to helpful information within the project.\\n\\nCONTRIBUTING.md\\n\\nThe CONTRIBUTING.md is another special file that is used to describe the process for collaborating on the repository. The link to the CONTRIBUTING.md file is shown when a user attempts to create a new issue or pull request.\\n\\nUsing GitHub Issues\\n\\nUse GitHub issues to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier in a variety of ways, by:\\n\\nReplacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the\\n\\nteam has the complete story.\\n\\nUsing GitHub Issues | 9\\n\\nAllowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests.\\n\\nCreating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made\\n\\ncertain decisions.\\n\\nAllowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation.\\n\\nActivity: Creating A GitHub Issue\\n\\nFollow these steps to create an issue in the class repository:\\n\\nActivity Instructions\\n\\n1. Click the Issues tab.\\n\\n2. Click New Issue.\\n\\n3. Type a subject line for the issue.\\n\\n4. A - followed by a space and [ ] will create a handy checklist in your\\n\\nissue or pull request.\\n\\n5. When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a\\n\\nnotification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.\\n\\n6. A # followed by the number of an issue or pull request (without a\\n\\nspace) in the same repository will create a cross-link.\\n\\n7. Tone is easily lost in written communication. To help, GitHub allows you to drop emoji into your comments. Simply surround the emoji id with :.\\n\\nUsing Markdown\\n\\nGitHub uses a syntax called Markdown to help you add basic text formatting to issues.\\n\\nCommonly Used Markdown Syntax\\n\\n# Header\\n\\nThe `# ` indicates a Header. # = Header 1, ## = Header 2, etc.\\n\\nList item\\n\\nA single * followed by a space will create a bulleted list. You can also use a -.\\n\\n10 | Getting Started With Collaboration\\n\\nBold item\\n\\nTwo asterix ** on either side of a string will make that text bold.\\n\\n[ ] Checklist\\n\\nA - followed by a space and [ ] will create a handy checklist in your issue or pull request.\\n\\n@mention\\n\\nWhen you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.\\n\\n#975\\n\\nA # followed by the number of an issue or pull request (without a space) in the same repository will create a cross-link.\\n\\n:smiley:\\n\\nTone is easily lost in written communication.

Simply surround the emoji id with :.\\n\\nActivity: Creating A GitHub Issue | 11\\n\\nUnderstanding the GitHub Flow\\n\\nIn this section, we will discuss the collaborative workflow enabled by GitHub.\\n\\nThe Essential GitHub Workflow\\n\\nFigure 5. GitHub Workflow.\\n\\nThe GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment with new ideas safely, without fear of compromising a project.\\n\\nBranching is a key concept you will need to understand. Everything in GitHub lives on a branch. By convention, the \"blessed\" or \"canonical\" version of your project lives on a branch called master.\\n\\nWhen you are ready to experiment with a new feature or fix an issue, you create a new branch of the project. The branch will look exactly like master at first, but any changes you make will only be reflected in your branch. Such a new branch is often called a \"feature\" branch.\\n\\nAs you make changes to the files within the project, you will commit your changes to the feature branch.\\n\\nWhen you are ready to start a discussion about your changes, you will open a pull request. A pull request doesn’t need to be a perfect work of art - it is meant to be a starting point that will be further refined and polished through the efforts of the project team.\\n\\nWhen the changes contained in the pull request are approved, the feature branch is merged onto the master branch. In the next section, you will learn how to put this GitHub workflow into practice.\\n\\n12 | Understanding the GitHub Flow\\n\\nBranching with Git\\n\\nThe first step in the GitHub Workflow is to create a branch. This will allow us to separate our work from the master branch.\\n\\nBranching Defined\\n\\nFigure 6. GitHub Workflow.\\n\\nWhen you create a branch, you are essentially creating an identical copy of the project at that point in time that is completely separate from the master branch.\\n\\nThis keeps your the code on your master branch safe while you experiment and fix issues.\\n\\nLet’s learn how you can create a new branch.\\n\\nActivity: Creating A Branch with GitHub\\n\\nEarlier you created an issue about a change you would like to introduce into the project. Let’s create a branch that you will use to add your file.\\n\\nFollow these steps to create a new branch in the class repository:\\n\\nActivity Instructions\\n\\n1. Navigate to the class repository.\\n\\n2. Click the branch dropdown.\\n\\n3. Enter the branch name \\'firstname-lastname-hometown\\'.\\n\\nBranching Defined | 13\\n\\n4. Press Enter.\\n\\nWhen you create a new branch on GitHub, you are automatically switched to your branch. Now, any changes you make to the files in the repository will be applied to this new branch.\\n\\n\\uf071\\n\\nA word of caution. When you return to the repository or click the top level repository link, notice that GitHub automatically assumes you want to see the items on the master branch. If you want to continue working on your branch, you will need to reselect it using the branch dropdown.\\n\\n14 | Branching with Git\\n\\nLocal Git Configuration\\n\\nIn this section, we will prepare your local environment to work with Git.\\n\\nChecking Your Git Version\\n\\nFirst, let’s confirm your Git Installation:\\n\\n$ git --version $ git version 2.7.0\\n\\nIf you do not see a git version listed or this command returns an error, you may need to reinstall Git.\\n\\n\\uf05a To see what the latest version of Git is, visit www.git-\\n\\nscm.com.\\n\\nGit Configuration Levels\\n\\nFigure 7. Git Configuration Levels.\\n\\nChecking Your Git Version | 15\\n\\nGit allows you to set configuration options at three different levels.\\n\\n--system\\n\\nThese are system-wide configurations. They apply to all users on this computer.\\n\\n--global\\n\\nThese are the user level configurations. They only apply to your user account.\\n\\n--local\\n\\nThese are the repository level configurations. They only apply to the specific repository where they are set.\\n\\n\\uf05a The default value for git config is --local.\\n\\nViewing Your Configurations\\n\\n$ git config --list\\n\\nIf you would like to see which config settings have been added automatically, you can type git config --list. This will automatically read from each of the storage containers for config settings and list them.\\n\\n$ git config --global --list\\n\\nYou can also narrow the list to a specific configuration level by including it before the list option.\\n\\nConfiguring Your User Name and Email\\n\\n$ git config --global user.name \"First Last\" $ git config --global user.email \"you@email.com\"\\n\\n\\uf05a\\n\\nGit uses the config settings for your user name and email address to generate a unique fingerprint for each of the commits you create.\\n\\n16 | Local Git Configuration\\n\\nConfiguring a Default Text Editor\\n\\n$ git config --global core.editor \"atom --wait\"\\n\\nNext, we will add the default text editor git will use when you need to edit things like commit messages. If you have downloaded and installed the open source text editor atom, the command shown above will configure it properly.\\n\\n\\uf05a\\n\\nIf you are using a Mac, you will need to install the shell commands from the Atom menu before the command above will work.\\n\\nIf you would like to use a different editor you can find additional instructions at https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors- with-git/\\n\\nConfiguring autocrlf\\n\\n$ //for Windows users $ git config --global core.autocrlf true $ //for Mac or Linux users $ git config --global core.autocrlf input\\n\\nDifferent systems handle line endings and line breaks differently. If you open a file created on another system and do not have this config option set, git will think you made changes to the file based on the way your system handles this type of file.\\n\\n\\uf05a Memory Tip: autocrlf stands for auto carriage return line\\n\\nfeed.\\n\\nConfiguring Default Push Behavior\\n\\n$ git config --global push.default simple\\n\\nOne final configuration option we will want to set is our default value for push. When you push changes from your local computer to the remote you\\n\\nConfiguring a Default Text Editor | 17\\n\\ncan choose whether you want git to automatically push all of the local branches to their matching branches on the remote or whether you only want the currently checked out branch to be pushed. The config setting we use to set this option is push.default. We can set the default to matching if we want to push all branches automatically. OR, we can set it to simple if we only want to push the branch we are on.\\n\\n18 | Local Git Configuration\\n\\nWorking Locally with Git\\n\\nIf you prefer to work on the command line, you can easily integrate Git into your current workflow.\\n\\nCreating a Local Copy of the repo\\n\\nFigure 8. Cloning a repository.\\n\\nBefore we can work locally, we will need to create a clone of the repository.\\n\\nWhen you clone a repository you are creating a copy of everything in that repository, including its history. This is one of the benefits of a DVCS like git - rather than being required to query a slow centralized server to review the commit history, queries are run locally and are lightning fast.\\n\\nLet’s go ahead and clone the class repository to your local desktop.\\n\\nActivity Instructions\\n\\n1. Navigate to the class repository on GitHub.\\n\\n2. Copy the clone URL.\\n\\n3. Open the CLI.\\n\\n4. Type git clone <URL>.\\n\\n5. Type cd <repo-name>.\\n\\nCreating a Local Copy of the repo | 19\\n\\nOur Favorite Git command: git status\\n\\n$ git status On branch master nothing to commit, working directory clean\\n\\ngit status is a command you will use often to verify the current state of your repository and the files it contains. Right now, we can see that we are on branch master, everything is up to date with origin/master and our working directory is clean.\\n\\nUsing Branches locally\\n\\n$ git branch\\n\\nIf you type git branch you will see a list of local branches.\\n\\n$ git branch --all $ git branch -a\\n\\nIf you want to see all of the branches, including the read-only copies of your remote branches, you can add the --all option or just -a.\\n\\n\\uf05a The --all and -a are actually synonyms in Git. Git often\\n\\nprovides a verbose and a short option.\\n\\nSwitching Branches\\n\\n$ git checkout <branch-name>\\n\\nTo checkout the branch you created online, type git checkout and the name of your branch. You do not need to type remotes/origin in front of the branch - only the branch name. You will notice a message that says your branch was set up to track the same remote branch from origin.\\n\\n20 | Working Locally with Git\\n\\nActivity: Creating a New File\\n\\nActivity Instructions\\n\\n1. Clone the class repository to your local desktop.\\n\\n2. Check out your branch.\\n\\n3. Create a file named after your home town with the .md extension.\\n\\n4. Save the file.\\n\\n5. Close your text editor.\\n\\nThe Two Stage Commit\\n\\nAfter you have finished making your changes, it is time to commit them. When working from the command line, you will need to be familiar with the idea of the two stage commit.\\n\\nFigure 9. The Two Stage Commit - Part 1.\\n\\nWhen you work locally, your files exist in one of four states. They are either untracked, modified, staged, or committed.\\n\\nAn untracked file is one that is not currently part of the version controlled directory.\\n\\nActivity: Creating a New File | 21\\n\\nFigure 10. The Two Stage Commit - Part 2.\\n\\nTo add these files to version control, you will create a collection of files that represent a discrete unit of work. We build this unit in the staging area.\\n\\nFigure 11. The Two Stage Commit - Part 3.\\n\\nWhen we are satisfied with the unit of work we have assembled, we will commit everything in the staging area.\\n\\n22 | Working Locally with Git\\n\\nFigure 12. The Two Stage Commit - Part 4.\\n\\nIn order to make a file part of the version controlled directory we will first do a git add and then we will do a git commit. Let’s do it now.\\n\\n$ git status $ git add my-file.md $ git status $ git commit $ git status\\n\\nWhen you type the commit command without any options, Git will open your default text editor to request a commit message. Simply type your message on the top line of the file. Any line without a # will be included in the commit message.\\n\\nTips for Good Commit Messages\\n\\nGood commit messages should:\\n\\nBe short. ~50 characters is ideal.\\n\\nDescribe the change introduced by the commit.\\n\\nTell the story of how your project has evolved.\\n\\nActivity: Creating a New File | 23\\n\\nCollaborating on Your Code\\n\\nNow that you have made some changes in the project locally, let’s learn how to push your changes back to the shared class repository for collaboration.\\n\\nPushing Your Changes to GitHub\\n\\nFigure 13. Pushing to GitHub.\\n\\nNow that you have made some changes and committed them locally, it is time to push them up to the remote. In this case, our remote is GitHub.com, but this could also be your company’s internal instance of GitHub Enterprise.\\n\\nTo push your changes to GitHub, you will use the command:\\n\\n$ git push -u origin <branch-name>\\n\\n\\uf05a\\n\\nThe -u is the short version of the option --set -upstream. This option tells Git to create a relationship between our local branch and a remote tracking branch of the same name.\\n\\n24 | Collaborating on Your Code\\n\\nActivity: Creating a Pull Request\\n\\nPull Requests are used to propose changes to the project files. A pull request introduces an action that addresses an Issue. A Pull Request is considered a \"work in progress\" until it is merged into the project.\\n\\nNow that you have created a file, you will open a pull request to discuss the file with your team mates. Follow these steps to create a Pull Request in the class repository:\\n\\nActivity Instructions\\n\\n1. Click the Pull Request icon.\\n\\n2. Click New Pull Request.\\n\\n3. In the base dropdown, choose master\\n\\n4. In the compare dropdown, choose your branch.\\n\\n5. Type a subject line and enter a comment.\\n\\n6. Use markdown formatting to add a header and a checklist to your Pull\\n\\nRequest.\\n\\n7. @mention the teacher.\\n\\n8. Use one of the keywords closes, fixes, or resolves to note which\\n\\nIssue the Pull Request resolves.\\n\\n9. Use Preview to see how your Pull Request will look.\\n\\n10. Assign the Pull Request to yourself.\\n\\n11. Click Create Pull Request.\\n\\n\\uf05a\\n\\nWhen you navigate to the class repository, you should see a banner at the top of the page indicating you have recently pushed branches, along with a button that reads Compare & pull request. This helpful button will automatically start the pull request process between your branch and the repository’s default branch.\\n\\nExploring a Pull Request\\n\\nNow that we have created a Pull Request, let’s explore a few of the\\n\\nActivity: Creating a Pull Request | 25\\n\\nfeatures that make Pull Requests the center of collaboration:\\n\\nConversation view\\n\\nSimilar to the discussion thread on an Issue, a Pull Request contains a discussion about the changes being made to the repository. This discussion is found in the Conversation tab and also includes a record of all of the commit that have been made on the branch.\\n\\nCommits view\\n\\nThe commits view contains information about who has made changes to the files. Each commit is an updated view of the repository, allowing us to see how changes have happened from commit to commit.\\n\\nFiles changed view\\n\\nThe Files changed view allows you to see the change that is being proposed. We call this the diff. Notice that some of the text is highlighted in red. This is what has been removed. The green text is what has been added.\\n\\nCode Review in Pull Requests\\n\\nTo provide feedback on proposed changes, GitHub offers two levels of commenting:\\n\\nGeneral Conversation\\n\\nYou can provide general comments on the Pull Request within the Conversation tab.\\n\\nLine Comments\\n\\nIn the files changed view, you can hover over a line to see a blue + icon. Clicking this icon will allow you to enter a comment on a specific line. These line level comments are a great way to give additional context on recommended changes. They will also be displayed in the conversation view.\\n\\nExploring\\n\\nHere are some additional resources you may find helpful:\\n\\n26 | Collaborating on Your Code\\n\\nguides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ An interactive\\n\\nguide on using Markdown on GitHub.\\n\\nExploring | 27\\n\\nEditing Files on GitHub\\n\\nSince you created the pull request, you will be notified when someone adds a comment. In this case, the comment may ask you to make a change to the file you just created. Let’s see how GitHub makes this easy.\\n\\nEditing a File on GitHub\\n\\nTo edit a pull request file, you will need to access the Files Changed view.\\n\\nClick the edit icon to access the GitHub file editor.\\n\\nCommitting Changes on GitHub\\n\\nOnce you have made some changes to your file, you will need to create a new commit.\\n\\nRemember, a good commit message should describe what was changed in the present tense. For example, Add favorite color.\\n\\nSince we accessed our file through the pull request, GitHub helpfully directs us to commit our changes to the same branch. Choose the option to Commit directly to your branch and click Commit changes.\\n\\n\\uf05a\\n\\nIf you want to see what was changed in a specific commit, you can go to the Commits tab and click on the Commit ID you would like to view.\\n\\n28 | Editing Files on GitHub\\n\\nMerging Pull Requests\\n\\nNow that you have made the requested changes, your pull request should be ready to merge.\\n\\nMerge Explained\\n\\nWhen you merge your branch, you are taking the content and history from your feature branch and adding it to the content and history of the master branch.\\n\\nFigure 14. Merge visual.\\n\\n\\uf05a\\n\\nMany project teams have established rules about who should merge a pull request. Some say it should be the person who created the pull request since they will be the ones to deal with any issues resulting from the merge. Others say it should be a single person within the project team to ensure consistency. Still others say it can be anyone other than the person who created the pull request. This is a discussion you should have with the other members of your team.\\n\\nMerge Explained | 29\\n\\nMerging Your Pull Request\\n\\nLet’s take a look at how you can merge the pull request.\\n\\nFirst, let’s use some emoji to indicate we have checked over the Pull Request and it looks good to merge. We like to use :+1: :ship: or :shipit:.\\n\\nActivity Instructions\\n\\n1. Open the Pull Request to be merged\\n\\n2. Open the Conversation view\\n\\n3. Scroll to the bottom of the Pull Request and click the Merge pull\\n\\nrequest button\\n\\n4. Type your merge commit message\\n\\n5. Click Confirm merge\\n\\n6. Click Delete branch\\n\\n7. Click Issues and confirm your original issue has been closed\\n\\nCleaning Up Your Branches\\n\\nWhen you merged your Pull Request, you deleted the branch on GitHub, but this will not automatically delete your local copy of the branch. Let’s go back to our Terminal and do some cleanup.\\n\\n$ git checkout master $ git pull ¬ $ git branch --all ¬\\n\\n① retrieves all of the changes from GitHub and brings them down to your\\n\\nlocal machine.\\n\\n② shows you all of the branches that exist locally, both ones you can work\\n\\nwith and the read-only copies of the remote tracking branches.\\n\\nYou will probably see that your branch is still there, both as a local branch and as a read-only remote tracking branch.\\n\\n$ git branch --merged\\n\\n30 | Merging Pull Requests\\n\\nAdding the --merged option to the git branch command allows you to see which branches have history equivalent to the history on the checked out branch. In this case, since we are checked out to master, we will use this command to ensure all of the changes on our feature branch have been merged to master before we delete the branch.\\n\\nTo delete the local branch, type the following command:\\n\\n$ git branch -d <branch-name>\\n\\nIf you type git branch --all again, you will see that your local branch is gone but the remote tracking branch is still there. To delete the remote tracking branch, type:\\n\\n$ git pull --prune\\n\\n\\uf05a\\n\\nIf you would like pruning of the remote tracking branches to be set as your default behavior when you pull, you can use the following configuration option: git config --global fetch.prune true.\\n\\nMerging Your Pull Request | 31\\n\\nViewing Local Changes\\n\\nNow that you are familiar with the basic workflow, let’s explore some of the powerful Git and GitHub features that will help you work with your code.\\n\\nDifferent Commands for Viewing Changes\\n\\nFigure 15. Git Diff Options.\\n\\nThe git diff command allows you to see the difference between files in the working and staging directories and what is in your history.\\n\\n$ git diff $ git diff --staged $ git diff HEAD $ git diff --color-words\\n\\n32 | Viewing Local Changes\\n\\nViewing Local Project History\\n\\nIn this section, you will discover commands for viewing the history of your project.\\n\\nUsing Git Log\\n\\nWhen you clone a repository, you receive more than just the files in that the repository. You also receive the history of all of the commits made in that repository.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at some of the option switches you can use with the log command to customize your view of the project history.\\n\\n$ git log $ git log --oneline $ git log --oneline --graph $ git log --oneline --graph --decorate $ git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all $ git log --stat $ git log --patch\\n\\n\\uf05a\\n\\nUse the up and down arrows or press enter to view additional log entries. Type q to quit viewing the log and return to the command prompt.\\n\\nUsing Git Log | 33\\n\\nFixing Commit Mistakes\\n\\nIn this section, we will begin to explore some of the ways Git and GitHub can help us shape our project history.\\n\\nChanging Commits\\n\\nCommit amend allows us to fix mistakes in our last commit. Two of the most common uses are:\\n\\nRe-writing commit messages\\n\\nAdding files to the commit\\n\\nWhen you are adding files to the previous commit, the files to be added should be in the staging area when you type the git commit --amend command.\\n\\n$ git commit --amend\\n\\n\\uf05a You can actually amend any data stored by the last commit\\n\\nsuch as commit author, email, etc.\\n\\n34 | Fixing Commit Mistakes\\n\\nStreamlining Your Workflow with Aliases\\n\\nSo far we have learned quite a few commands. Some, like the log commands, can be long and tedious to type. In this section, you will learn how to create custom shortcuts for Git commands.\\n\\nCreating Custom Aliases\\n\\nAn alias allows you to type a shortened command to represent a long string on the command line.\\n\\nFor example, let’s create an alias for the log command we learned earlier.\\n\\nOriginal Command\\n\\n$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all\\n\\nCreating the Alias\\n\\n$ git config --global alias.lol \"log --oneline --graph --decorate --all\"\\n\\nUsing the Alias\\n\\n$ git lol\\n\\nOther Common Aliases\\n\\n$ git config --global alias.co \"checkout -b\" $ git config --global alias.ss \"status -s\"\\n\\nExplore\\n\\nCheck out this resource for a list of common aliases:\\n\\ngit-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases A helpful overview of\\n\\nsome of the most common git aliases.\\n\\nCreating Custom Aliases | 35\\n\\nWorkflow Review Project: GitHub Games\\n\\nIn this section, we will complete a project using the GitHub Flow.\\n\\nUser Accounts vs. Organization Accounts\\n\\nThere are two major account types in GitHub, user accounts and organization accounts. While there are many differences in these account types, on of the more notable differences is how you handle permissions.\\n\\nUser Accounts\\n\\nOur first class repository was in a user account for GitHub Teacher. Permissions for a user account are simple, you simply add people as collaborators to give them full read-write access to the project.\\n\\nOrganization Accounts\\n\\nOrganization accounts provide more granular control over repository permissions. In an organization account you will create teams of people and then give those teams access to specific repositories. You can also designate the type of access a team should have (e.g, read only, read-write, or admin).\\n\\nWhat is a Fork?\\n\\nA fork is a full copy of a repository that resides on a different account. They are easiest to understand in the context of Open Source, but are also commonly used in organizations to control who can merge a pull request. Essentially, you will use a fork to make changes to a repository when you do not have write access. At the moment you create the fork, it is an exact duplicate of the parent repository.\\n\\nCreating a Fork\\n\\nActivity Instructions\\n\\n1. Navigate to the repo githubschool/github-games.\\n\\n2. Click Fork.\\n\\n3. Select the account you would like the fork to reside.\\n\\n36 | Workflow Review Project: GitHub Games\\n\\nIntroduction to GitHub Pages\\n\\nGitHub Pages enable you to host a free, static web page directly from your GitHub repository. The github-games project will use GitHub Pages. We will barely scratch the surface in this class, but there are a few things you need to know:\\n\\nYou can create two types of websites, a user/organization site or a\\n\\nproject site. We are creating a project website.\\n\\nFor a project site, GitHub will look for a special gh-pages branch and\\n\\nonly serve the content on that branch.\\n\\nThe rendered site for your fork will appear at username.github.io/github-games.\\n\\nWorkflow Review: Updating the README.md\\n\\nFirst, let’s practice the GitHub Flow from beginning to end by updating the link in the README to point to your fork of the repository.\\n\\nWe have intentionally left these steps very high level since they are a review. If you need help with any of these steps, refer to the earlier section of this manual:\\n\\nWorkflow Review Activity\\n\\n1. Clone your fork of the repository locally.\\n\\n2.

It contains the following information:\\n\\nThe version of every blob in the repository\\n\\nThe author of the commit\\n\\nThe author’s email\\n\\nThe date and time of the commit\\n\\nThe commit message\\n\\nFigure 16. Commit and tree structure.\\n\\nEach commit also contains the commit ID of its parent commit.\\n\\n38 | Reverting Commits\\n\\nFigure 17. Parents and Children.\\n\\nImage source: ProGit v2 by Scott Chacon\\n\\nSafe Operations\\n\\nGit’s data structure gives it integrity but its distributed nature also requires us to be aware of how certain operations will impact the integrity of the data that has been shared.\\n\\nIf an operation will change a commit ID that has already been pushed to the remote (also known as a public commit), we must be careful in choosing the operations to perform.\\n\\nTable 1.

Push your changes to GitHub.\\n\\nMoving and Renaming Files with Git | 43\\n\\nRewriting History with Git Reset\\n\\nIn this section, you will learn how to re-write history with Git.\\n\\nUnderstanding Reset\\n\\nSometimes we are working on a branch and we decide things aren’t going quite like we had planned. We want to reset some, or even all, of our files to look like what they were at a different point in history. We can do that with git reset.\\n\\nFigure 18. Git Reset Before and After.\\n\\nRemember, there are three different snapshots of our project at any given time. The first is the most recent commit. The second is the staging area (also called the index). The third is the working directory (i.e. whatever you currently have saved on disk). The git reset command has three modes, and they allow us to change some or all of these three snapshots.\\n\\nIt also helps to know what branches technically are: each is a pointer, or reference, to the latest commit in a line of work. As we add new commits, the currently checked-out branch \"moves forward,\" so that it always points to the most recent commit.\\n\\n44 | Rewriting History with Git Reset\\n\\nReset Modes\\n\\nFigure 19. The three modes of reset.\\n\\nThe three modes for git reset are: --soft, --mixed, and --hard. For these examples, assume that we have a \"clean\" working directory, i.e. there are no uncommited changes.\\n\\nsoft\\n\\ngit reset --soft <my-branch> <other-commit> moves <my-branch> to point at <other-commit>. However, the working directory and staging area remain untouched. Since the snapshot that <my-branch> points to now differs from the index’s snapshot, this command effectively stages all differences between those snapshots. This is a good command to use when you have made a large number of small commits and you would like to regroup them into a single commit.\\n\\nmixed\\n\\nWith the --mixed option, Git makes <my-branch> and the staging area look like the <other-commit> snapshot. This is the default mode: if you don’t include a mode flag, Git will assume you want\\n\\nReset Modes | 45\\n\\n--mixed. --mixed is useful if you want to keep all of your changes in the working directory, but change whether and how you commit those changes.\\n\\nhard\\n\\n--hard is the most drastic option. With this, Git will now make all 3 snapshots, <my-branch>, the staging area, and your working directory, look like they did at <other-commit>. This can be dangerous! We’ve assumed so far that our working directory is clean. If it is not, and you have uncommited changes, git reset --hard will delete all of those changes. Even with a clean working directory, use --hard only if you’re sure you want to completely undo earlier changes.\\n\\nNext we will try out each of these options.\\n\\nCreating a Local Repository\\n\\nSince git reset rewrites history, you should avoid using it on commits that have already been made public (e.g. pushed to the repository on GitHub).\\n\\nTo avoid teaching you bad habits, we will create a practice repository. This time, we will start the repository locally, from the command line.\\n\\nActivity Instructions\\n\\n1. Navigate to the directory where you will place your practice repo.\\n\\n2. Type git init practice-repo.\\n\\n3. Type cd practice-repo.\\n\\n4. Create a README.md file and use it as your initial commit.\\n\\nReset Soft\\n\\nTo prepare for this activity, you will need to create four files and commit each separately so your file directory looks like this:\\n\\n46 | Rewriting History with Git Reset\\n\\n$ ls file1.md file2.md file3.md file4.md README.md\\n\\nAnd your history looks like this:\\n\\n$ git log --oneline fj8weq4 init file 4 3487nio init file 3 39dj58s init file 2 dke03md init file 1 84nqdkq initializing repo with README\\n\\nNow that your repository is set up, let’s try our first reset.\\n\\n1. Use the log alias we created earlier to look at the history of our project.\\n\\n2. Identify the current location of HEAD.\\n\\n3. We want to go back two commits in our history so we will type git\\n\\nreset --soft HEAD~2.\\n\\n4. Type git status. The changes we made in the last two commits\\n\\nshould be in the staging area waiting to be committed.\\n\\n5. Using the log command, we can see that the HEAD is now sitting two\\n\\ncommits earlier than it was before we used git reset.\\n\\n6. Go ahead and re-commit these changes with git commit -m\\n\\n\"grouping commits for cleaner history\".\\n\\n\\uf05a\\n\\nIn this example, the tilde tells git we want to reset to two commits before the current location of HEAD. You can also use the first few characters of the commit ID to pinpoint the location where you would like to reset HEAD.\\n\\nReset Mixed\\n\\nAfter the soft reset, your file directory should still look like this:\\n\\nTo prepare for this activity, you will need to create four files and commit\\n\\nReset Mixed | 47\\n\\neach separately so your file directory looks like this:\\n\\n$ ls file1.md file2.md file3.md file4.md README.md\\n\\nBut your history should now look like this:\\n\\n$ git log --oneline 78fjuoz grouping commits for cleaner history 39dj58s init file 2 dke03md init file 1 84nqdkq initializing repo with README\\n\\nNext we will try the mixed reset:\\n\\n1. Once again, we will start by viewing the history of our project.\\n\\n2. This time we only want to go back one commit in history so we will\\n\\ntype git reset HEAD~ OR git reset <SHA>.\\n\\n3. Type git status. The changes we made in the last commit have\\n\\nbeen moved back to the working directory.\\n\\n4. This time, we will need to git add the files to the staging area before\\n\\nwe can commit them.\\n\\n5. Go ahead and re-commit the files with git commit -m \"another\\n\\nreset example\".\\n\\n\\uf05a Remember, mixed is the default mode for the reset\\n\\ncommand.\\n\\nReset Hard\\n\\nLast but not least, let’s try a hard reset.\\n\\n1. Start by viewing the history of our project.\\n\\n2. This time we reset to the point in time where the only file that existed\\n\\nwas the README.md. Type git reset --hard <SHA>.\\n\\n48 | Rewriting History with Git Reset\\n\\n3. Type git status. Notice your working directory is clean.\\n\\n4. Viewing the history of your project will reveal a single commit.\\n\\n\\uf071\\n\\nRemember, git reset --hard is a destructive command. Don’t use it unless you really want to discard your changes.\\n\\nDoes Gone Really Mean Gone?\\n\\nThe answer: It depends!\\n\\nType the command git reflog.\\n\\nThe reflog is a record of every place HEAD has been. In a few minutes we will see how the reflog can be helpful in allowing us to retrieve changes we didn’t mean to discard. But first, we need to be aware of some of the reflog’s limitations:\\n\\nThe reflog only includes your local history. In other words, you can’t see the reflog for someone else’s local commits and they can’t see yours.\\n\\nThe reflog is a limited time offer. By default, reachable commits are held in the reflog for 90 days, but unreachable commits (meaning commits that are not attached to a branch) are only kept for 30 days.\\n\\nExploring\\n\\nHere are some interesting things you can check out later:\\n\\nguides.github.com/introduction/flow/ An interactive review of the\\n\\nGitHub Workflow.\\n\\nDoes Gone Really Mean Gone? | 49\\n\\nCherry Picking\\n\\nWe just learned how reflog can help us find local changes that have been discarded. So what if:\\n\\nYou Just Want That One Commit\\n\\nCherry picking allows you to pick up a commit from one branch of the project and move it to your current branch. Right now, your file directory and log should look like this:\\n\\n$ ls README.md $ git lol 84nqdkq initializing repo with README\\n\\nLet’s try it:\\n\\n1. Create and checkout to a new branch named cherry-picking.\\n\\n2. Using the reflog, find the commit ID where you added file2.md.\\n\\n3. Type git cherry-pick <SHA>.\\n\\nNow when you view your directory and log, you should see:\\n\\n$ ls file2.md README.md $ git lol eanu482 init file 2 84nqdkq initializing repo with README\\n\\n\\uf071\\n\\nRemember, when using any commands that change history, it’s important to make these changes to your commits before pushing to GitHub. Any time you change the commit ID of something in shared history, you risk creating problems. Others working with the same repository won’t have the re-written history.\\n\\nIs the commit ID the same as the one you used in the cherry pick command? Why or why not?\\n\\n50 | Cherry Picking\\n\\nMerge Strategies: Rebase\\n\\nIn this section, we will discuss another popular merge strategy, rebasing.\\n\\nAbout Git rebase\\n\\nThe rebase command enables you to modify your commit history in a variety of ways. For example, you can use it to reorder commits, edit them, squash multiple commits into one, and much else.\\n\\nTo enable all of this, rebase comes in several forms. For today’s class, we’ll be using interactive rebase: git rebase --interactive, or git rebase -i for short.\\n\\nTypically, you would use git rebase -i to:\\n\\nEdit previous commit messages\\n\\nCombine multiple commits into one\\n\\nDelete or revert commits that are no longer necessary\\n\\n\\uf071\\n\\nBecause changing your commit history can make things difficult for everyone else using the repository, it’s considered bad practice to rebase commits you’ve already pushed to a repository.\\n\\nRebasing commits against a branch\\n\\nTo rebase all the commits between another branch and the current branch state, you can enter the following command in your shell (either the command prompt for Windows, or the terminal for Mac and Linux):\\n\\ngit rebase --interactive other_branch_name\\n\\nRebasing commits against a point in time\\n\\nTo rebase the last few commits in your current branch, you can enter the following command in your shell:\\n\\ngit rebase --interactive HEAD~7\\n\\nAbout Git rebase | 51\\n\\nFigure 20. Git Rebase.\\n\\nActivity: Git Rebase Practice\\n\\nActivity Set Up Instructions\\n\\n1. Type git checkout -b rebase-me.\\n\\n2. Create 2-3 new files on your branch (HINT: you can use touch\\n\\nfile1.md file2.md file3.md).\\n\\n3. Add and commit each file seperately.\\n\\n4. Type git checkout master.\\n\\n5. Create 2-3 new files on master (e.g. touch file4.md file5.md\\n\\nfile6.md).\\n\\n6. Take a look at your history by typing git log --oneline --graph\\n\\n--decorate --all.\\n\\nBegin the Rebase\\n\\n1. Type git checkout rebase-me.\\n\\n2. Start the merge by typing git rebase -i master.\\n\\n3. Your text editor will open, allowing you to see the commits to be\\n\\nrebased.\\n\\n4. Save and close the rebase-todo.\\n\\n5. Watch your rebase happen on the Command Line.\\n\\nCheck it Out\\n\\n1. See your cool changes by typing git log --oneline --graph\\n\\n--decorate --all.\\n\\n2. Go back to master by typing git checkout master.\\n\\n3. Merge your changes in to master by typing git merge rebase-me.\\n\\n52 | Merge Strategies: Rebase\\n\\nAppendix A: Talking About Workflows\\n\\nDiscussion Guide: Team Workflows\\n\\nHere are some topics you will want to discuss with your team as you establish your ideal process:\\n\\n1. Which branching strategy will we use?\\n\\n2. Which branch will serve as our \"master\" or deployed code?\\n\\n3. Will we use naming conventions for our branches?\\n\\n4. How will we use labels and assignees?\\n\\n5. Will we use milestones?\\n\\n6. Will we have required elements of Issues or Pull Requests (e.g.\\n\\nshipping checklists)?\\n\\n7.
